/*
Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

Example

--> For s = "abacabad", the output should be solution(s) = 'c'.

  There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

--> For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be solution(s) = '_'.

  There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

Input/Output

--> [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

--> [input] string s

  A string that contains only lowercase English letters.

  Guaranteed constraints:
  1 â‰¤ s.length â‰¤ 105.

--> [output] char

The first non-repeating character in s, or '_' if there are no characters that do not repeat.
